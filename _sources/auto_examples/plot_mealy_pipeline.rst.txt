Model Error Analysis with scikit-learn Pipeline for the Adult income dataset
============================================================================

Here we train a RandomForestClassifier to predict whether a person gains
more or less than 50k per year. This is our primary model.
Before training the primary model we preprocess the categorical and numeric
features of the dataset by means of a scikit-learn Pipeline.
Then we build a secondary model, called Error Tree,
to predict on what samples the primary model returns wrong or correct predictions.
The Error Tree is a DecisionTree returning a binary outcome success/failure. The leaves
yielding failure outcome gather the samples mis-predicted by the primary
model. Plotting the feature distributions of these samples and comparing
to the whole data highlights the subpopulations where the model works poorly.

Build the preprocessing Pipeline.
#############################################################################
 The final Pipeline is required to contain two steps: the first step should
 be a `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` accounting for the preprocessing of
 the features, while the second step should be a `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`,
 representing the primary model to investigate.
 The `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` should contain the desired
 preprocessing steps by groups of columns. The columns not specified in the
 `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` are dropped by default, unless using the
 option `remainder='passthrough'`, in which case they are included without
 preprocessing.

Discussion
----------

Error Tree Metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are dealing with a binary classification task.
Here the primary predictions of "income less or more than 50k" have been categorized
in two classes: 'Correct prediction' and 'Wrong prediction' according to the difference
from the true class. The accuracy is then the number of Correct predictions over the total.
The Error Tree might not be representative of the behavior of the primary model as the true primary
accuracy and the one estimated by the Error Tree are not close.

Model Failures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's focus on the nodes of the Error Tree, in particular the leaves
of class 'Wrong prediction'. These leaves contain the majority of errors, each
leaf clustering a subpopulation of errors with different feature values. The largest
and purest failure nodes are highlighted when printing the error node summary, and
also when plotting the feature distributions in the node (``leaf_selector=None``).
From the feature distributions, sorted by correlation with the error, we can see that
the majority of problems occur for married people.
In the next iteration of model design, the primary model needs to be improved for these
subpopulations.
