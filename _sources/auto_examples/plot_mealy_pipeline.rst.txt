Model Error Analysis with scikit-learn Pipeline for the Adult income dataset
============================================================================

Here we train a RandomForestClassifier to predict whether a person gains
more or less than 50k per year. This is our primary model.
Before training the primary model we preprocess the categorical and numeric
features of the dataset by means of a scikit-learn Pipeline.
Then we build a secondary model, called Error Tree,
to predict on what samples the primary model returns wrong or correct predictions.
The Error Tree is a DecisionTree returning a binary outcome success/failure. The leaf nodes
yielding failure outcome gather the samples mis-predicted by the primary
model. Plotting the feature distributions of these samples and comparing
to the whole data highlights the subpopulations where the model works poorly.

    The Error Decision Tree (EDT) was trained with accuracy 84.60% and balanced accuracy 50.99%.
    The Decision Tree estimated the primary models accuracy to 99.40%.
    The true accuracy of the primary model is 84.49.%
    The Fidelity of the EDT is 85.09%.
    Warning: the built EDT might not be representative of the primary model performances.
    The EDT predicted model accuracy is considered too different from the true model accuracy.

We are dealing with a binary classification task.
Here the primary predictions of "income less or more than 50k" have been categorized
in two classes: 'Correct prediction' and 'Wrong prediction' according to the difference
from the true class. The accuracy is then the number of Correct predictions over the total.
The Error Tree might not be representative of the behavior of the primary model as the true primary
accuracy and the one estimated by the Error Tree are not close.

Model Failures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's focus on the nodes of the Error Decision Tree, in particular the leaf nodes
of class 'Wrong prediction'. These leaves contain the majority of errors, each
leaf clustering a subpopulation of errors with different feature values. The largest
and purest failure nodes are highlighted when printing the error node summary, and
also when plotting the feature distributions in the node (``leaf_selector=None``).
From the feature distributions, sorted by correlation with the error, we can see that
the majority of problems occur for married people.
In the next iteration of model design, the primary model needs to be improved for these
subpopulations.
