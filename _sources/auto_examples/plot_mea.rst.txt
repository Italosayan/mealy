Model Error Analysis for the Boston houses dataset
===================================================================

Here we train a RandomForestRegressor to predict the price of the houses
in Boston. This is our primary model. Then we build a secondary model,
called Model Performance Predictor (MPP), to predict on what samples
the primary model returns wrong or correct predictions. The MPP is a
DecisionTree returning a binary outcome success/failure. The leaf nodes
yielding failure outcome gather the samples mis-predicted by the primary
model. Plotting the feature distributions of these samples and comparing
to the whole data highlights the subpopulations where the model works poorly.

Those are the necessary imports and initializations.

Discussion

Model Performance Predictor Metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are dealing with a regression task, but the metrics highlight the accuracy
of the primary model and its estimate given by the Model Performance Predictor.
Here the primary predictions of price have been categorized in two classes:
'Correct prediction' and 'Wrong prediction' by thresholding the deviation of
the prediction from the true value. Close enough predictions are Correct prediction,
the others are Wrong prediction. For more details, have a look at the documentation.
The accuracy is then the number of Correct predictions over the total.
The MPP is representative of the behavior of the primary model as the true primary
accuracy and the one estimated by the MPP are close.

Model Failures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's focus on the nodes of the MPP DecisionTree, in particular the leaf nodes
of class 'Wrong prediction'. These leaves contain the majority of errors, each
leaf clustering a subpopulation of errors with different feature values. The largest
and purest failure nodes are highlighted when printing the error node summary, and
also when plotting the feature distributions in the node (``leaf_selector="all_errors"``).
From the feature distributions, sorted by correlation with the error, we can see that
the majority of problems occur for extreme values of features ``LSTAT`` and ``AGE``.
In the next iteration of model design, the primary model needs to be improved for these
subpopulations.
